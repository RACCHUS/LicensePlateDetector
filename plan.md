## Project Overview

The **License Plate Detector** is a Python application that uses multiple OCR engines to detect and automatically input license plate text. The application captures screen regions, processes them through various OCR engines, and uses consensus-based validation to determine the most accurate license plate text, if not confident it will alert the user to manually input the text.

### Current Architecture

- **Main Application**: PyQt GUI application (modularized in `gui/`) with multi-engine OCR
- **Models**: `models.py` - Shared OCRResult dataclass
- **OCR Engines**: Modular engine files in `ocr/` directory for different OCR backends
- **Utilities**: `utils/` directory with image processing, validation, and state filtering
- **State Filtering**: US state name/abbreviation filtering available and integrated

### Available OCR Engines

1. **EasyOCR** - Engine available in `ocr/easyocr_engine.py`
2. **PaddleOCR** - Engine available in `paddleocr_engine.py` (root) and `ocr/paddleocr_engine.py`
3. **Keras-OCR** - Engine available in `ocr/kerasocr_engine.py`
4. **DocTR** - Engine available in `ocr/doctr_engine.py`
5. **Tesseract** - Engine available in `ocr/tesseract_engine.py`


## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: State Reporting Not Implemented**
- **Issue**: State filtering is used in OCR engines, but detected states are not reported in the GUI or results.
- **Impact**: Users do not see which state (if any) was detected.
- **Fix Required**: Add state reporting to the OCR workflow and display in the GUI/results.

### 2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Inconsistent Engine Organization**
- **Issue**: Some engine wrappers or legacy code remain in the root directory.
- **Impact**: Confusing project structure and inconsistent imports.
- **Fix Required**: Move all engine code to the `ocr/` directory and update imports.

### 3. **LOW PRIORITY: requirements.txt Cleanup**
- **Issue**: requirements.txt contains duplicates and inconsistent version constraints.
- **Impact**: Potential for dependency conflicts and confusion.
- **Fix Required**: Deduplicate and clean up requirements.txt.

## Recommended Fix Priority

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Before Making Any Changes:**
1. **Backup Current State**: `git add . && git commit -m "Backup before critical fixes"`
2. **Virtual Environment**: ‚úÖ venv310 activated with Python 3.10.0
3. **Test Current Functionality**: Confirmed syntax error on line 30 prevents execution

**After Each Fix:**
1. **Test Immediately**: Run `venv310\Scripts\python.exe -c "import license_plate_app"` to verify syntax
2. **Check All Imports**: Ensure no new import errors were introduced
3. **Test Application Start**: Run `venv310\Scripts\python.exe license_plate_app.py` to verify GUI loads
4. **Update This Plan**: Mark completed items and remove resolved issues
5. **Commit Changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix: [description]"`

**Emergency Rollback**: If something breaks, use `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### Phase 1: Import and Runtime Fixes (Next Sprint)
1. **Standardize engine organization** - Move all engines to `ocr/` directory
2. **Fix log_result method calls** - Add missing method to LicensePlateRecognizer or handle gracefully
3. **Fix GUI interaction bugs** - Add missing instance variables and fix variable scoping

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Future)
1. **Integrate state detection** - Use existing state_filters.py utilities in OCR workflow
2. **Add state reporting** - Include state detection in GUI and results output
3. **Add comprehensive error handling**
4. **Add logging configuration**
5. **Performance optimization**

## Current Environment Status
- **Note**: Use `venv310\Scripts\python.exe` directly to ensure correct Python version

### Dependencies Status
- **TensorFlow**: Still constrained to <2.13; monitor for compatibility issues



### Project Structure Issues
- **Import Paths**: Inconsistent between actual file locations and import statements

## Technical Debt

### Architecture Issues
- **Mixed Engine Organization**: Engines split between root and `ocr/` directories
- **Import Path Confusion**: Imports don't match actual file locations
- **Incomplete Implementations**: Partial class definitions and syntax errors
- **Python Version Mismatch**: Running Python 3.13.4 with packages expecting 3.10.x


### Code Quality Issues
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Some engines handle errors, others don't

### Recommendations
1. **Switch to Python 3.10.x**: Use the intended venv310 environment
2. **Fix requirements.txt**: Correct typos and update version constraints
3. **Test OCR Library Compatibility**: Verify all engines work with chosen Python version

## Security Considerations

### Current Risks
- **Screen Capture**: Unrestricted screen access
- **Keyboard Automation**: Automatic typing without safeguards
- **No Input Validation**: Limited validation of OCR results

### Recommendations
- Add user confirmation for sensitive operations
- Implement rate limiting for automation
- Add input sanitization for OCR results
- Consider adding audit logging

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance Characteristics
- **Multi-Engine Processing**: Runs all OCR engines sequentially
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Good for accuracy, expensive computationally
- **Image Preprocessing**: Basic but effective pipeline
- **Memory Usage**: Likely high due to multiple ML models loaded

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Parallel OCR Processing**: Run engines concurrently
- **Lazy Loading**: Load OCR models only when needed
- **Result Caching**: Cache results for identical image regions
- **Engine Selection**: Use faster engines first, slower ones only if needed

## Conclusion

The License Plate Detector project has a well-designed architecture with multi-engine OCR integration and consensus-based validation. However, it currently **cannot run due to critical syntax errors and import issues**. The project is in a broken state that requires immediate fixes to become functional.




**Current Status**

Tkinter code and references have been removed. The project is now fully migrated to PyQt.

## üîß Quick Reference & Troubleshooting

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Test basic imports (use correct Python executable)
venv310\Scripts\python.exe -c "import license_plate_app"

# Test specific modules
venv310\Scripts\python.exe -c "from models import OCRResult; print('Models OK')"
venv310\Scripts\python.exe -c "from utils.validation import clean_license_plate; print('Utils OK')"

# Check Python environment
venv310\Scripts\python.exe -c "import sys; print('Python version:', sys.version)"
```

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Syntax Errors:**
- Look for incomplete class definitions
- Verify all import statements match actual file locations

**Import Errors:**
- Verify engine files exist in expected locations
- Check if engines should be in root or ocr/ directory
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed with correct names
